Python Starter Template
===========================================
Start your python projects off right!  Use this template.

Basic Usage
-----------
Create a new project on Github and use this repo as a template.

Clone the newly made repo.

Once cloned, create a virtual environment.  You made nead to download additional packages if this is your first time creating a virtual environment.

```
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

Activate your virtual environment
```
// Unix
source ./venv/bin/activate

// Windows
source ./venv/Scripts/activate
```
You'll know you're in the virtual environment as your terminal will now be prefixed with `(venv) user@pc`.

Its a good idea to update pip.
```
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```







Installation
------------
$ pip install new_project
